 ## Exercise: Screening Messages

 You've somehow come to possess a huge list of messages about a series of characters: Caterpillar, Dormouse, Cheshire Cat, and others. The list is contained in the `aliceMessages` constant below.
 
 Try to print out the `aliceMessages` array to see the whole list, but beware: It's large enough that it may cause your playground to run slowly.
 */
import Foundation

aliceMessages


/*:
 The Caterpillar has asked you to go through the messages and to relay any that contain the Caterpillar's name. Instead of reading all the text yourself, you decide to write more code to help.
 
 - callout(Exercise): Create a `for…in` loop to process the `aliceMessages` collection.\
In the body of the loop, check whether each message `contains` the string "Caterpillar".\
If the message refers to the Caterpillar, print it to the console.
 

 - note:\
 The `contains` method is part of the `Foundation` framework that you read about in the “Types” playground. If you try using it and get an error saying “Value of type 'String' has no member 'contains',” follow the instructions from that playground to import the framework into your project.
